This week I worked:

_Used Fast API to make a request to retrieve data from the third-party API (TMDB)
_ Retrieved Movie data for trending, popular,
and movies by genre. Retrieved TV Show data for trending, popular, and by genre

Andrew was able to retrieve the JSON data and render it on the front-end for our carousels.

\*Working on the database structure for logged-in users to add movies
/shows to a watch-later and seen it list. The DB will have a relation
to user_id so we can retrieve and render the lists that are associated with the user from the DB.

\*Completed building the databases. DBs for must watch and seen it tables are both showing
up in pg-admin. I started to work on connecting the API routes for CRUD operations on the
must_watch list.
