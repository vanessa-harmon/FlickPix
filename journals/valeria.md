This week I worked on:

- Getting the back-end login, logout, and create an account authentication functionality.
- I also created a database for our application and designed the accounts table.

I worked on Back-end FASTAPI to create queries and routes to create an account, get protected, login, and logout, and to retrieve a token.

I learned how to use pgAdmin to create a database and manipulate the accounts in the database. I coincidentally just learned about the F2/Rename symbol functionality in VS Code and it allows me to rename a variable once and it automatically replaces all instances of the variable everywhere else.
