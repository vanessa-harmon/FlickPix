## Thursday - 9/28/23

This week I worked on:

- getting the front end up and running functionally for all the pages.

- making a nav bar with everything in place that we needed

- making multi carousels to display the information as needed

- learned how to make a modal, then made a modal for movies and shows
  to get a more detailed look at the item you choose

- added minimum css styling to make it look a bit better

I had to coordinate with Chris in order to get the data from the backend up and running on the front end side.
I originally had a different idea for the carousel on hover preview, but that backfired on me due to how the
react multi carousel works. So instead I opted to do an on click preview and have a modal pop up. It looks
really cool and I am glad with how it turned out!
