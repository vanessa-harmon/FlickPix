## Thursday - 9/28/23

This week I worked on:

- getting the front end up and running functionally for all the pages.

- making a nav bar with everything in place that we needed

- making multi carousels to display the information as needed

- learned how to make a modal, then made a modal for movies and shows
  to get a more detailed look at the item you choose

- added minimum css styling to make it look a bit better

I had to coordinate with Chris in order to get the data from the backend up and running on the front end side.
I originally had a different idea for the carousel on hover preview, but that backfired on me due to how the
react multi carousel works. So instead I opted to do an on click preview and have a modal pop up. It looks
really cool and I am glad with how it turned out!

This week, I worked on:

- making a functional search bar

- making cards to display the results

- making the endpoints for the search

This was took a lot longer for me than I intended but it got done.
Working with a 3rd party API made me realize that I needed to send
the query to the API first then receive those results, and then
display them to the cards. I also learned how to make endpoints in
fastAPI for the search. Overall, the functionality is there and it
displays nicely for the user. Will add pagination during stretch
goal week.

This week, I worked on:

- Home page carousels

- added Trending Carousel for TV page

- added New Carousel for TV page

- added a home button to the navbar

- Home page modals

This week has been a bit hectic for me, but I still accomplished a lot.
I made a Home page for us, and added a single display react carousel
that shows new, trending, & popular movies AND tv shows. This was a
challenge because the earlier modals and carousels only retrieved
popular items for their respective category. It was a challenge to make
it work together for sure, but nothing too crazy.

This week, I worked on:

- adding trailers to the modals

- unit testing

Our project is nearly wrapped up, and its looking great. I added video
trailers to the modals for each movie and tv show! I also made it autoplay
whenever it was opened. I should probably make an option to toggle
autoplay on or off in the future. Unit testing was a pain. Chris and I
were trying to figure out how to implement a unit test that test the
retrieval of 3rd part API results, but after trying for 2 days we decided
that we should just test something a bit simpler.
