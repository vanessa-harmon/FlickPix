This week, I worked on:

* Movie and Show Detail pages

I worked on these pages to fetch and display data.
Using CSS Grid to make the page visually appealing.

This week I had a couple of a-ha moments. With the
help of my team and Dalonte I was able to get my Docker
environment up and running. When I first built my volumns
and started up my container I was receieving errors.
My team debugged and helped me get the correct pulls
over from Gitlab. I also needed to delete my Node modules
and completely rebuild.
After this week I have a better understanding of CSS grid.

This week, I worked on:

* Carousels for the movie and show recommendations

I fetch the data from the backend. With the help of
Andrew I was able to then dsiplay this data in a
carousel on the detail page. So, when a user visits
a specific show or movie they are provided with a
list of similar/recommended movies/shows. You can then
click a recommended show/movie and be redirected to
the details.

A major a-ha moment was trying to get the page to scroll
to the top when a recommended show/movie was selected.
I had to add a click handle to the link as well for this redirect.

This week, I worked on:

* Ade and I worked on the watch-later and seen-it pages.

I coded the watch-later component and Ade coded the seen-it
component. Added the watch-later/seen-it buttons to the
show/movie detail page so user could add to their list when
viewing a specific show/movie. Chris helped as well, it getting
the add buttons to work. I finished up the CSS for the detail
pages. I added a "more.." button to the randomizer that will guide
user to the detail page.

A major-aha moment was reviewing the data returned when adding
to the watch-later list. Working with Chris we realized the
character limitations preventing a show/movie from being added.

This week, I worked on:

* As a group, we worked on unit testing and deployment. I began working
on the README for our project.

Unit test were really challenging. I went back and read the learn
and watched the lecture in hopes to come back to my team with some knowledge
as we were all uneasy going into unit testing. Ade and I began working on the
one test and then we had the whole group working together to try and figure it
out. A couple SEIRs came in to help, as well as both instructors at different
points. After rough drafting the readme, I had the team review and we discussed
what else needed to be added.

A major a-ha moment was when Dalonte was assiting with
unit test and had us changed the format of our authenticator we finally were able
to get the test to run.
