This week, I worked on:

* Movie and Show Detail pages

I worked on these pages to fetch and display data.
Using CSS Grid to make the page visually appealing.

This week I had a couple of a-ha moments. With the
help of my team and Dalonte I was able to get my Docker
environment up and running. When I first built my volumns
and started up my container I was receieving errors.
My team debugged and helped me get the correct pulls
over from Gitlab. I also needed to delete my Node modules
and completely rebuild.
After this week I have a better understanding of CSS grid.
