This week, I worked on:

* Movie and Show Detail pages

I worked on these pages to fetch and display data.
Using CSS Grid to make the page visually appealing.

This week I had a couple of a-ha moments. With the
help of my team and Dalonte I was able to get my Docker
environment up and running. When I first built my volumns
and started up my container I was receieving errors.
My team debugged and helped me get the correct pulls
over from Gitlab. I also needed to delete my Node modules
and completely rebuild.
After this week I have a better understanding of CSS grid.

This week, I worked on:

* Carousels for the movie and show recommendations

I fetch the data from the backend. With the help of
Andrew I was able to then dsiplay this data in a
carousel on the detail page. So, when a user visits
a specific show or movie they are provided with a
list of similar/recommended movies/shows. You can then
click a recommended show/movie and be redirected to
the details.

A major a-ha moment was trying to get the page to scroll
to the top when a recommended show/movie was selected.
I had to add a click handle to the link as well for this redirect.
