This week I worked on:

- The back-end for the Show and Movie detail pages

- Started onnecting the routes from the front-end to the back-end

I used FASTAPI to create routes to fetch data in regards to the tv/movie details by the medias ID, the cast involved with the tv/movie, and the providers that allow you too watch the movie.

I initially had trouble receiving specific data in regards to the cast as the reference called for every contributor to the show/movie. So i had to figure out a way to filter out the actors only from the API so that we would solely receive the data necessary.
